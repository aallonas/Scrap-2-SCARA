# Scrap-2-SCARA

**One man’s trash is another man’s treasure.**

The goal of this project is to build and program the cheapest reasonably capable SCARA robot possible. By leveraging second-hand parts, repurposed components, and careful budgeting, I’ve managed to create a functional robotic arm at a fraction of the usual cost.

The entire project cost a total of **xxx.xx€**, of which **xxx.xx€** I consider mandatory expenses for essential parts and materials. The remaining **xxx.xx€** represents optional luxury spending—components or upgrades that improve performance or aesthetics but are not strictly necessary for the robot to function.

Please note that prices may vary between builds, especially since most hardware was sourced second-hand or repurposed from other projects. For reference and transparency, I have listed the prices based on their original retail value when bought new, even if the parts were acquired second-hand or reused.
